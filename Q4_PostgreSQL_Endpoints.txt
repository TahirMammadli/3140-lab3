>> app.post('/create', (req, res) => { //database table })
>> The post function above should create the database. 
>> Example: The function creates a database table that contains squirrel_sighting_id, color_key, activity, age, date, time, and location_id columns. 
app.post('/create', (req, res) => {
  const {squirrel_sighting_id, color_key, activity, age, date, time, location_id} = req.body
  client.query("insert into squirrel_sighting (squirrel_sighting_id, color_key, activity, age, date, time, location_id) values ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7)", 
                                              [squirrel_sighting_id, color_key, activity, age, date, time, location_id])
  console.log(req.body)
}) 

>> app.get('/dbpopulate', (req, res) => { //add data in the table})
>> The get function above populate the database with data. 
>> Example: The function pre-populate the database
app.get('/dbpopulate', (req, res) => {
  dbPopulate(3, process.argv.slice(2).toString())
})

>> app.get('/read', (req, res) => { //query database })
>> The get function above read the query of the database.
>> Example: 
app.get('/read', (req, res) => {
  const response = client.query("select * from squirrel_sighting ion_id").then(res => console.log(res).catch(e => console.log(e)))
})

>> app.put('/update', (req, res) => { //query database })
>> The put function above update the data in the table. 
>> Example: The function update activity value to "Racing" and age value to "juvenile" to the squirrel with the squirrel_sighting_id of 7
app.put('/update', (req, res) => {
  client.query("update squirrel_sighting set activity = 'Racing', age = 'juvenile' where squirrel_sighting_id = 7")
})

>> app.delete('/delete', (req, res) => { //query database })
>> The delete function above delete the data in the table. 
>> Example: The function delete the data that has "Juvenile" in age column in the squirrel_sighting table. 
app.delete('/delete', (req, res) => {
  client.query("delete from squirrel_sighting where age = 'Juvenile'")
})
